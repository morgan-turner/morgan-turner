### Hi there, I'm Morgan 👋

I'm a data analyst with a passion for healthcare and policy data. I've worked in healthcare for the last several years and am excited to bring the insights I gained there to the world of data analytics.

- 💁🏽‍♀️ Pronouns: she/her
- 🚀 Fun fact: I love space! I follow every NASA launch and discovery 'cause I think they're so cool. In another life I'd have been an astronaut!
