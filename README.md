### Hi there, I'm Morgan 👋

I'm a data analyst with a passion for using data to make the world a better place. I have an eye for detail and love to dig into a data rabbit hole when there's something unusual to check out. I'm interested in a broad range of data applications, including those in healthcare, climate/sustainability/energy, the sociopolitical landscape, economics, and physics/astronomy/space exploration.
